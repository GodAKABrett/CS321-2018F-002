The purpose of Spirits is to search for them throughout the map, and once found, the Spirits can be captured. They are a collectible for the world to give the player more activities to do. There are twenty unique Spirit types for the player to collect. Different Spirit types spawn randomly throughout the world and move around, occasionally shifting in and out of reality. The Spirits are supposed to be a hard collectible to catch, so it becomes a challenge capturing them all.

The player may capture the Spirits, using the “capture” command. The player has a checklist of Spirits. If a new Spirit type is captured, and the type is not crossed off on the list, the list will automatically update when the new Spirit type is captured.

The Spirit checklist may be displayed with the command, “spirit log”. Any type already captured will end each line with a “-C”.
